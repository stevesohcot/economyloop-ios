I had to make an iOS app that displayed a webpage.  When an external link on the webpage was clicked, I needed it to appear in a new window (the reason had to do with, it was an RSS feed, and you legally can't include it via a frame/iframe). When the user clicked on an external link, I wanted a new window, within my app, to come up, and there would be a "back" button to return them to the main page.
